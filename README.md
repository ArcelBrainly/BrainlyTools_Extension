If you have any questions or suggestions, please create a new issue.
I'd be happy to hear your thoughts.


### Attention please :warning:

Issues/Feature requests can be written in different languages other than English. Because we have lots of users from many countries that can't speak English well enough. So that we have no restriction about that. But if you like to post anything, please choose your words carefully and create elegant and smooth sentences in your language so that we can understand by translating your posts via Google Translate.

Thanks in advance!
